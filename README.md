This is an application for leading a Tech Talk exercise. It is built using React. To run the site locally use `yarn start`.

It consists of:
* Instructions
* Registration
* Progress Meter

#### Instructions
These instructions inform the user how to complete the DevOps Challenge.

#### Registration
The user enables the progress meter by first inputting their GitHub username.

#### Progress Meter
The progress meter uses the user's GitHub username to track their status along the challenge.

For example...

One step of the instructions is to fork a repository on GitHub. The progress meter can check if the user has forked the repo. That is one of the first steps. When they have forked it, the progress meter automatically checks that off confirming that they are on track to complete the challenge.
